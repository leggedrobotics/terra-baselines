# Configuration file for LLM (Large Language Model) settings
# This file contains various settings for the LLM environment, agent behavior, partitioning, application,
# rendering, intervention system, and enhanced delegation.

# Environment settings

force_delegate_to_llm: false        # Force delegation to LLM agent for testing
llm_call_frequency: 15              # Number of steps between LLM calls

# Partitioning settings  
use_manual_partitioning: false      # Use manual partitioning 
use_random_partitioning: true      # Use random partitioning 
max_num_partitions: 1               # Maximum number of partitions for LLM (Partitioning Agent)
use_exact_number_of_partitions: false # Use exact number of partitions for LLM (Partitioning Agent)
use_image_prompt: true              # Use image prompt for LLM (Partitioning Agent)
use_exclusive_assignment: false      # Use exclusive assignment for partition-specific target maps

# Application settings
